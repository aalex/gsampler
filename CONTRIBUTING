Version Number
--------------

It is made of major.minor.micro numbers. Releases with an odd minor version number are in an unstable branch, whose API and command line argument might change. (sometimes a lot) When the minor number is even, it means it's a stable branch, with only new features that don't break old ones, or bug fixes. 

The version number is located in configure.ac and must always be one micro number ahead, unless this is a tag. That means that if we have released 0.1.0, the version number in configure.ac must be 0.1.1 until we release 0.1.1, and so forth.


The ChangeLog File
------------------

It is generated by calling the following command:

 $ git log --pretty=medium > ChangeLog


Creating a Tarball - The Release Process
----------------------------------------

Make sure the RELEASE notes, the NEWS file are up-to-date.
Make sure the version number in configure.ac is correct.
Commit any pending changes.

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make dist

Update the version number in configure.ac to the next release to come.


The RELEASE notes and the NEWS file
-----------------------------------

The RELEASE file contains the release notes for the current (or next) release. We list there the bugs fixed and the new features. We also explain the reason for some changes if needed. The NEWS file contains all the previous release notes. For example, for a tag 0.1.3, it should contain the release notes for 0.1.0 to 0.1.2.


The README File
---------------

We use the GNU Autotools, and Automake overwrites the INSTALL file. Therefore, we write the installation instructions in the README file, along with a quick explanation of how to use the software, and what it does.


The Manual Page
---------------

The text of manual page for this software is located in the following file:

 man/man-gsampler.txt

We use help2man to generate a man page from this file and from the program's output. The man page is the primary location for any help and documentation about using this software.


Codign Style
------------

Camel case file names? Curly brackets?
