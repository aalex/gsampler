Dystophonia
-----------

Steampunk themed tank game. 

Developers Notes
----------------

Hopes to use: 

 * Bullet or Box2D (probably Bullet)
 * OSC (maybe with a registration mechanism to one of the peers that's a server)
 * STK (audio synthesis only !)
 * OSG (if necessary)

Mercurial Notes
---------------
For Mercurial, there are some ignored files in .hgignore. To clean every file 
that is not committed, do this :

  hg purge --all 

Bullet Notes
------------

It's easier to break a rigidbody dynamics engine then to make effective use of it. Some rules of thumb might help: sizes of less then 0.2 are not supported. Large mass ratios are not supported either (avoid 100kg on top of 1kg), don't use huge sizes for collision shapes (<10 units). If you need a larger static environment, use either triangle meshes with reasonable sized triangles (< 10 units), or a plane shape.
