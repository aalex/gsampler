Developers Notes

Hopes to use: 

 * Bullet or Box2D (probably Bullet)
 * OSC (maybe with a registration mechanism to one of the peers that's a server)
 * STK (audio synthesis only !)
 * OSG (if necessary)

For Mercurial, there are some ignored files in .hgignore. To clean every file 
that is not committed, do this :

  hg purge --all
